#need to add a calculation for tuition tables: 
    #the average and median per degree level (college, bachelore, masters, phd) all programes per year
    #the average increase in tuition fees against last year (%) and difference
    #the average calculation for the cost of full degree based on the minimum period of study required and study form: 
        #college: 2 years PLK
        #bachelore: 3-4 years PLK
        #masters: 2-3 years PLK
        #doctors: 4 years PLK
    #the average monthly payment if the tuition is covered by the student's finances not loan
    #how does the average monthly payment compare to the age group's for the specific degree average calculated cost of living and earned salary?
