# Tuition and salary dynamic
Due to inflation experienced over the last 4 years, there have been an increase in all costs while salaries have experienced significantly smaller increase or even stagnation. As education is one of the pillars that help to increase overall wealth especially if it is choosen in less desirable but more rewarding fields like STEM, it should be researched if the tuition fees have kept up with the cost of living increase rate therefore increasing the need for study loans and potentially adding a financial burden on the ones who desire to achieve higher education or the tuition have kept up with the salary increase rate and have not added an extra burden rather kept the same level as previously. 

This is a study project created to showcase the existing skills of Python for webscraping, database creation and working with the database via SQL commands and applying the best principles of Python according to PEP8 guidlines. This is not an academic grade and comprehensive study and comparison. 

### Data sources
Salaries over the last 4 years - national statistics database
Inflation over the last 4 years - TBA
Tuition - RTU due to convinience in accessing the tuition fees, the university primarily focused on STEM and it is governmental University which should be more accessible to general public when compared to private universities. 

### Steps of the project
1. Scrape information from RTU study programe page and it's archived versions since 2020 using BeutifulSoup
2. Transform the data as needed and load it into a .db file for further actions
3. Find information in National statistics database and access it via one of the provided options (API exist)
4. Extract, Transform and Load the information in a different .db file
5. Find information on inflation rates (and if possible cost of living dynamic)
6. Extract, Transform and Load the information in a different .db file
7. USing SQL commands access the appropriate information needed to analyze the data
8. Create visualisation for the data using plotly or matplotlib
9. At each significant python code addition check if the code conforms to the PEP8 guidlines using PyLint
