#Get additional salary data - earnings by education level - do majority of the people have earnings level that outweight the tuition cost for the degree? 
#For the most objective we can take also specific averages: 
    #assume the person started bachelor in PLK in 2019/2020 study year and bachelor was 4 years long
    #assume that after bachelor a masters degree was aquired (start PLK 2023/2024; finish 2024/2025)
    #calculate the aproximate salary increase due to inflation 
    #does the person can afford to pay out-of-pocket for master's studies with the average bachelor's degree salary accounting for living expenses?
    #does the total cost of studies can be justified on average? 
    #assume that half of the study period was paid by the government - how does that look like now? 
    #assume that all bachelor and masters were funded by government - how does that look like
    #calculate the same things for NLK or NLN student - there is no scholarship or government funded positions - how does the numbers look like now?
